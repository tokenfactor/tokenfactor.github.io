# Research
I'm interested in the intersections among emerging technologies, civic systems & infrastructures, and urban resilience. I look at initiatives meant to develop and build urban resilience -- the capacity of cities to withstand various types of disruptions caused by rapid urbanization and disasters (financial, cyber warfare, climate change, etc). I examine the role of power, economics, politics, and culture, and the impact of tech adoption/tech-emboldened city initiatives on vulnerable populations across the globe.
