# Hello
My name is Lovely-Frances Domingo.

I am an information security professional by trade, formerly an educator and technology programs coordinator for a local community center in Seattle. I completed my Master of Science in Information Management (MSIM) from the University of Washington (UW) Information School, and my Bachelor of Arts in English, with a minor in History and significant courses taken in Southeast Asian studies from UW. 

# Research
I'm interested in the intersections among emerging technologies, infrastructures, and urban resilience in city-wide efforts to withstand various types of disruptions caused by rapid urbanization, disasters caused by natural causes or cyber warfare, climate change, etc. I focus my research on human factors, examine the role of power, economics, politics, and culture, and the impact of tech adoption/tech-emboldened city initiatives on vulnerable populations.
