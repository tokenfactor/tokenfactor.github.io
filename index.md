# Hello
My name is Lovely-Frances Domingo.

I am an information security/information assurance consultant for a cybersecurity firm, formerly an educator and technology programs coordinator for a local community center in Seattle. I completed my Master of Science in Information Management (MSIM) from the University of Washington (UW) Information School, my Bachelor of Arts in English, with a minor in History and have taken significant courses in Southeast Asian studies (Jackson School of International Studies) from UW.

# Research
I’m interested in the intersections among emerging technologies, systems & infrastructures, information security, and urban resilience. I look at initiatives meant to develop and build urban resilience – the capacity of cities to withstand various types of disruptions caused by rapid urbanization and disasters (financial, cyber warfare, climate change, etc). I examine the role of power, economics, politics, and culture, and the impact of tech adoption/tech-emboldened city initiatives on vulnerable populations across the globe.
