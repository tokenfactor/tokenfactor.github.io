## About Me
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tokenfactor/tokenfactor.github.io/master/docs/assets/img/IMG_1477.jpg" height="250" align="right">

My name is Lovely-Frances Domingo. I'm an incoming PhD student in Information Studies at the University of Maryland, College Park. I have my MS in Information Management (UW iSchool) and BA in English, minor in History from the University of Washington. I served as an International Policy Institute (IPI) Cybersecurity Fellow at the UW Jackson School of International Studies (2018-2019), Community Technology Intern for the City of Seattle (2017-2018) and was affiliated with the UW Center for Communication, Difference and Equity (CCDE) as a Collaborative Project Scholar (2017-2018).

Professionally, I worked as an information security/information assurance consultant (PCI DSS), and have a background in nonprofits, community technology, and STEM education.  

I watch a lot of women's sports, especially women's basketball and the WNBA, and you might catch me tweeting about it or playing pick-up/league basketball game at a local gym.

  
## Research

I’m interested in the intersections among emerging technologies, systems & infrastructures, information security, and urban resilience. I look at initiatives meant to develop and build urban resilience – the capacity of cities to withstand various types of disruptions caused by rapid urbanization and disasters (financial, cyber warfare, climate change, pandemic, etc). I am particularly interested in examining the role of power, politics, and culture that play into technology adoption to understand potential harms and vulnerabilities and the impact of tech adoption/tech-emboldened city initiatives on vulnerable populations across the globe.
