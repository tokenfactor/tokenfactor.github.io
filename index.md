My name is Lovely-Frances Domingo. I'm an incoming PhD student in Information Studies at the University of Maryland, College Park. I have my MS in Information Management (UW iSchool) and BA in English, minor in History from the University of Washington. I served as an International Policy Institute (IPI) Cybersecurity Fellow at the UW Jackson School of International Studies (2018-2019), Community Technology Intern for the City of Seattle (2017-2018) and was affiliated with the UW Center for Communication, Difference and Equity (CCDE) as a Collaborative Project Scholar (2017-2018).

Professionally, I worked as an information security/information assurance consultant (PCI DSS), and have a background in nonprofits, community technology, and STEM education.  

I watch a lot of women's sports, especially women's basketball and the WNBA, and you might catch me tweeting about it or playing pick-up/league basketball game at a local gym.
