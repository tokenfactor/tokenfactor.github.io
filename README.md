# Hello
My name is Lovely-Frances Domingo.

I am an information security professional by trade, formerly an educator and technology programs coordinator for a local community center in Seattle. I completed my Master of Science in Information Management (MSIM) from the University of Washington Information School, and my Bachelor of Arts in English, with a minor in History from the University of Washington.

## Research
I'm interested in the intersections among emerging technologies, cities, infrastructures, and urban resilience. I focus my research on human factors, and the impact of tech adoption/tech-emboldened city initiatives on vulnerable populations, examining the role of power, economics, politics, and culture on technology adoption by cities in an effort to withstand various types of disruptions caused by rapid urbanization, natural disasters and climate change, war/terrorism, etc.
